# space_commander
Repo for space-commander pygame code. 
This project is a tutorial that I am expanding to code my first full-length game, Space Commander.
Space Commander requires the player to dodge asteroids and engage and destroy enemy spacecraft.
Enemy spacecraft will become progressively more aggressive and sophisticated.
The game will score by how many enemy spacecraft are defeated.
The game will feature orginal pixel art and chiptune soundtrack.
The final game will be shipped as a windows executable for distribution.
